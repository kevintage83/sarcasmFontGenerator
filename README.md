# Sarcasm Font Generator
Sarcasm Font Generator is an incredibly vital tool for the discerning keyboard warrior and internet troll alike! Ever wish you weren't spending so much time creating alternating upper and lower case letters to illustrate your almighty wit? Of course you do! Frustrated by the tedious nature of having to remember to add the "/s" at the end of your remarks to signify your wit and tact? I've got you covered! Just enter your text into the input field and click the conversion button. Being annoying on the internet has never been easier!

## Contributing
Pull requests? No, thank you! The repo is mainly a waste of time. Sometimes, I get bored or I have [bad] ideas that I've convinced myself are good ideas; this is one of those times. Normally, if this were a repository where pull requests were welcome, I would ask that (for major changes, at least) you please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change... but this is currently not the case.

I would also ask that you please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
